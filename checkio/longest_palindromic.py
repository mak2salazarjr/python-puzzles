"""
Write a function that finds the longest palindromic substring of a given string. Try to be as efficient as possible!
If you find more than one substring you should return the one which is closer to the beginning.
Input: A text as a string.
Output: The longest palindromic substring.
Precondition: 1 < |text| â‰¤ 20
The text contains only ASCII characters.
